## 🏗️ Data Source & Architecture

All analytics in this repository are built on top of a **MySQL Data Warehouse** that I designed and implemented **from scratch** using the **Medallion Architecture**:

- 🥉 **Bronze Layer** – Raw, ingested source data  
- 🥈 **Silver Layer** – Cleaned, validated, and standardized data  
- 🥇 **Gold Layer** – Business-ready fact and dimension tables for analytics  

The complete Data Warehouse implementation (ETL pipelines, transformations, and schema design) is available here:

🔗 **SQL Data Warehouse Project**  
👉 https://github.com/mehrasuaj/SQL-datawarehouse_project.git  

This analytics repository uses the **Gold layer** tables as its primary source, simulating how analytics teams work with production-ready data.
